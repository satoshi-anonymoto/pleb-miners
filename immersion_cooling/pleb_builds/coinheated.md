# CoinHeated's double loop pool heating system

https://youtu.be/bF6dDlb3j9g

Hot oil flows over the divider to the submerged plate heat exchanger. A submersible utility pump picks up the hot oil and pumps it through the plate heat exchanger and returns the now-cooled oil back into the immersion tank. A separate water loop runs through the plate heat exchanger and is pumped out to the pool and/or a radiator system for cooling.

Parts:
* [Engineering Fluids BitCool](https://www.engineeredfluids.com/bitcool): $180 for 20L (5.28gal); ships from Texas.
* 40gal "breeder" fish tanks from PetCo. Tested up to 170°, [silicon tank seals are compatible](https://t.me/ImmersionCoolingTechnologyTalk/16504) with BitCool. Breeder tanks are deeper and shorter than a typical tank.
